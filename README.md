# Autocad-Electrical-Project
This repository contains one of my university project. This file is basically a electrical wiring design of second floor NSTU admin building. This project includes cost estimation by using current calculation of the whole floor and also requirement of using safety device.

**Designed electrical wiring systems using AutoCAD Electrical, creating detailed schematics, layout diagrams, and specifying wires and safety devices. Conducted comprehensive cost estimations for materials and, ensuring safety and compliance with standards. Resulted in a well-documented, cost-effective electrical wiring plan.**
